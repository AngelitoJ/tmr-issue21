@BOOK{gurney_introduction_1997,
  title = {An Introduction to Neural Networks},
  publisher = {{CRC}},
  year = {1997},
  author = {Kevin Gurney},
  abstract = {Though mathematical ideas underpin the study of neural networks, the
	author presents the fundamentals without the full mathematical apparatus.
	All aspects of the field are tackled, including artificial neurons
	as models of their real counterparts; the geometry of network action
	in pattern space; gradient descent methods, including back-propagation;
	associative memory and Hopfield nets; and self-organization and feature
	maps. The traditionally difficult topic of adaptive resonance theory
	is clarified within a hierarchical description of its operation.
	The book also includes several real-world examples to provide a concrete
	focus. This should enhance its appeal to those involved in the design,
	construction and management of networks in commercial environments
	and who wish to improve their understanding of network simulator
	packages. As a comprehensive and highly accessible introduction to
	one of the most important topics in cognitive and computer science,
	this volume should interest a wide range of readers, both students
	and professionals, in cognitive science, psychology, computer science
	and electrical engineering.},

  title = {A simple scientific library for Haskell},
  abstract = {This is a short tutorial for hmatrix, a purely functional interface
	to basic matrix computations and other numerical algorithms, internally
	implemented using {GSL,} {BLAS} and {LAPACK.} It is not a direct
	and complete binding to these standard numeric libraries. Instead,
	we provide a higher level, user friendly interface to the most common
	functions. The goal is that simple applications which are typically
	solved using {GNU-Octave} or similar systems can be easily written
	in the more powerful Haskell language. Vectors and matrices are represented
	by different types, but dimension consistency is checked at run time.
	This library can be used as the underlying computational engine for
	more advanced interfaces. For instance, Reiner Popeâ€™s hmatrix-static
	supports compile-time checking of matrix and vector sizes.},
